# Space Race
This is one of my own projects, that I have made in my spare time. The game is about a ship that vanished from radars. You, as the player stumbled upon the ship, and want to find clues about the event that took place on the ship. The goal of the game is to find out what happened on the ship, that led to its disappearing. You are able to accomplish this goal, by finding all the keycards and opening the doors to new parts of the maps. While searching for the cards in the dark, the player does not need to fear about getting lost. The player does not need to fear getting lost, because the trusty AI (Henry) will help the player get trough the map, with it's excellent directions/hints. Lastly, the game is also foccused on making the player feel like a badass, while shooting enemies.


As you would expect, a good portion is made by myself. The only things that I did not make is the art. I tried to make everything as loosely coppled as I could, to increase readability/reusability. And at last, I rewrote/expanded on the excisting XR library.

## Educational goals
The things that I wanted to learn from this project are:
- I wanted to learn the functionalities of the Unity XR library
- I wanted to learn in's and outs of making a complete game
